# Credit-Card-Customer-Segmentation

We’ll play the role of a data scientist working for a credit card company. 

The dataset contains information about the company’s clients and we're asked to help segment them into different groups in order to apply different business strategies for each type of customer.

The company expects to receive a group for each client and an explanation of the characteristics of each group and the main points that make them different.

In order to use the algorithm properly and achieve all the goals that the company has set for us, we'll go through the following steps:

Analyze the dataset;

Prepare the data for modeling;

Find an appropriate number of clusters;

Segment the data;

Interpret and explain the results.
